## 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

This repository is about Python's variable annotations, a feature that allows you to specify the expected type of a variable. This is part of Python's type hinting system.

## Resources

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Learning Objectives

- **Type annotations in Python 3**: Type annotations are a feature in Python 3 that allow you to specify the expected type of a variable. This can help with code readability and debugging.

- **Function signatures and variable types**: Function signatures refer to the input parameters and return type of a function. By using type annotations, you can clearly state what type of values a function is expected to take and what it will return.

- **Duck typing**: Duck typing is a programming concept where the type or the class of an object is less important than the methods and properties it has. In other words, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck!

- **Code validation with mypy**: Mypy is a static type checker for Python. You can use mypy to check your code and ensure that the types of variables match with their assigned values. This can help catch potential bugs before runtime.

## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7). Please ensure that your code is compatible with this version of Python.
